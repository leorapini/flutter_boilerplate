# flutter_boilerplate

Boilerplate code and basic Clean Architecture folder structure for a new Flutter App.

## Motivation

Starting a new project is hard work. Many choices must be made when choosing the right architecture and so forth. I created this repository to expedite my development speed by choosing the most commom structure, architecture and packages I use. Obviously each project demands its own architecture, but this has helped me to get the ball rolling and start coding faster. 

## Technologies

- Flutter 3.3.2
- Dart 2.18.1

For dependencies please check the pubspeck.yaml file.
